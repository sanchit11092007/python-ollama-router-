# 🤖 Agent OTG — Local Autonomous Multi-Model AI Hub

**Agent OTG** is an air-gapped, on-premise, multi-model AI routing system that connects FastAPI, LangGraph, and Ollama. It automatically analyzes user intent, routes tasks to specialized local models, orchestrates multi-step pipelines (such as generating code and immediately explaining it), executes tools (Word, PDF manipulation, RAG document search), and provides full real-time terminal observability.

## ⚡ Quick Start & Running Procedure

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Windows Python Launcher Required**:
> On Windows, your default `python` command may point to an environment without packages (such as MSYS2/MinGW).
> **Always use `py`** to run scripts and servers on your machine.

### Step 1: Verify Ollama & Models
Ensure the Ollama service is active. Check that the required models are downloaded:
```powershell
ollama list
```
The recommended models for full functionality:
- `qwen2.5:7b` (Router & quick casual answers)
- `qwen2.5-coder:latest` (Code generation & debugging)
- `qwen2.5:14b` (In-depth reasoning, essays, LangGraph agent)
- `qwen2.5vl:7b` (Vision & image analysis)

If any model is missing, pull it using:
```powershell
ollama pull qwen2.5:7b
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:latest
ollama pull qwen2.5:14b
ollama pull qwen2.5vl:7b
```

### Step 2: Run the FastAPI / Uvicorn Server (Backend)
Open a terminal in the project directory:
```powershell
py -m uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```
When running, the server terminal provides full real-time visibility with structured, emoji-rich logs:
- `📥 [USER ACTION]`: Incoming endpoint, client IP, query, attachments
- `🧠 [ROUTER]`: Intent classification, category, selected model, pipeline decision
- `🤖 [MODEL]`: Model execution start, prompt details, response generation
- `🛠️ [TOOL]`: Tool invocation, input parameters, execution timing, results
- `📤 [RESPONSE]`: Model output preview, token count, execution latency
- `🌊 [STREAM]`: Live chunk delivery and streaming stages

---

### Step 3: Run the Interactive Terminal Client
Open another terminal window and start the interactive client:
```powershell
py ask.py
```
This opens an interactive shell with an automated capability showcase, command matrix, styled prompts, and colored stage badges.

## 🛡️ Privacy & Sovereign Security

- **Software Offline Guard (`offline_guard.py`)**: Intercepts outbound socket network calls to ensure no prompts or documents leak to external networks.
- **Local Persistence**: Session and project memory are saved in local SQLite; generated documents are saved under `generated_files/`.
